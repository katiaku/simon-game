# Simon Game

This project is my version of the Simon Game, a classic memory game, inspired by the tutorials provided by freeCodeCamp on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ">YouTube</a> and their <a href= "https://github.com/beaucarnes/simon-game/commit/2cc0493f723646e8ef4b0d3bea8c7e9b2847e46d">GitHub repository</a>. The Simon Game challenges players to remember and repeat a pattern of colors and sounds. It serves as a fun exercise for testing and improving one's memory skills.

### Technologies Used

The Simon Game project utilizes the following technologies

HTML: The structure of the game board and user interface elements are built using HTML.

CSS: Custom styling is applied using CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the game board and user interface.

JavaScript: The game logic, event handling, and functionality are implemented using JavaScript. JavaScript enables the creation of the game's interactive elements, such as generating random patterns, playing sounds, and capturing user input.

### Credits and Acknowledgements

This version of the Simon Game was developed based on the tutorials provided by freeCodeCamp on YouTube and their corresponding GitHub repository. I would like to express my gratitude to freeCodeCamp for creating and sharing the resources that made this project possible.
